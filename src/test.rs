//! Helpers for testing the web server and service.
//!
//! When writing tests, keep the following points in mind:
//!
//!  - In every test, call `test::setup`. This will set up the logger so that all console output is
//!    captured by the test runner.
//!
//!  - When using `test::tempdir`, make sure that the handle to the temp directory is held for the
//!    entire lifetime of the test. When dropped too early, this might silently leak the temp
//!    directory, since symbolicator will create it again lazily after it has been deleted. To avoid
//!    this, assign it to a variable in the test function (e.g. `let _cache_dir = test::tempdir()`).
//!
//!  - When using `test::symbol_server`, make sure that the server is held until all requests to the
//!    server have been made. If the server is dropped, the ports remain open and all connections
//!    to it will time out. To avoid this, assign it to a variable: `let (_server, source) =
//!    test::symbol_server();`. Alternatively, use `test::local_source()` to test without HTTP
//!    connections.
