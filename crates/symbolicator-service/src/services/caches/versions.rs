//! This module defines the various [`CacheVersions`] of the various caches that Symbolicator uses.
//!
//! # How to version
//!
//! The initial "unversioned" version is `0`.
//! Whenever we want to increase the version in order to re-generate stale/broken cache files,
//! we need to:
//!
//! * increase the `current` version.
//! * prepend the `current` version to the `fallbacks`.
//! * it is also possible to skip a version, in case a broken deploy needed to
//!   be reverted which left behind broken cache files.
//!
//! Some of the versioned caches are also tied to format versions defined in [`symbolic`].
//! For those cases, there are static assertions that are a reminder to also bump the cache version.

/// - `2`: Allow underflow in Win-x64 CFI which allows loading registers from outside the stack frame.

/// - `1`: Generate higher fidelity CFI for Win-x64 binaries.

/// - `4`: An updated symbolic symcache that uses a LEB128 prefixed string table.

///        - fixes problems with split inlinees and inlinees appearing twice in the call chain
///        - undecorate Windows C-decorated symbols in symcaches
///
/// - `2`: Tons of fixes/improvements in symcache generation:
///        - fixed problems with DWARF functions that have the

///        - fixed problems with PDB where functions have line records that don't belong to them
///        - fixed problems with PDB/DWARF when parent functions don't have matching line records
///        - using a new TypeFormatter for PDB that can pretty-print function arguments
///
/// - `1`: New binary format based on instruction addr lookup.
///
/// - `0`: Initial version.
