## Query Parameters

- `timeout`: If given, a response status of `pending` might be sent by the
  server.
- `scope`: An optional scope which will be used to isolate cached files from
  each other

## Request Body

    pub scraping: ScrapingConfig,
    pub options: JsRequestOptions,

A JSON payload describing the stack traces and code modules for symbolication,
as well as configuration for scraping sources from external servers:

- `source`: A descriptor for the Sentry source to be used for symbolication. See
  [Sentry](index.md) source.
- `modules`: A list of source code files with a corresponding debug id that
  were loaded during JS code execution. The list is handled by the Sentry source.
- `stacktrace`: A list of stacktraces to symbolicate.
  - `frames`: A list of frames with corresponding `abs_path`, `lineno`,
    and other optional fields like `colno` or minified `function` name.
- `release`: Name of Sentry `release` for the processed request.
- `dist`: Name of Sentry `dist` for the processed request.
- `scraping`: Configuration for scraping of JS sources and sourcemaps from the web.
  - `enabled`: Whether scraping should happen at all.
  - `allowed_origins`: A list of "allowed origin patterns" that control what
    URLs we are allowed to scrape from. Allowed origins may be defined in several ways:
    - `http://domain.com[:port]`: Exact match for base URI (must include port).
    - `*`: Allow any domain.
    - `*.domain.com`: Matches domain.com and all subdomains, on any port.
    - `domain.com`: Matches domain.com on any port.
    - `*:port`: Wildcard on hostname, but explicit match on port.
  - `headers`: A map of headers to send with every HTTP request while scraping.
- `options`: Symbolication-specific options which control the endpoint's behavior.
  - `apply_source_context`: Whether to apply source context for the stack frames.

## Response

See [Symbolication Response](response.md).
