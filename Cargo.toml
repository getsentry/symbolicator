# For debug builds, we do want to optimize for both debug-ability, and fast iteration times.
# To de able to "Debug Test", we do need full debug info.
# However especially on MacOS, incremental build times are primarily dominated by linking time.
# To help with that, one can try using `lld` as linker by adding the following to `.cargo/config.toml`:
# [build]
# rustflags = ["-C", "linker-flavor=ld64.lld"]
# OR (which I believe is equivalent):
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]

# For local development: uncomment the following three lines (and adjust the path if necessary)
# to use a local symbolic checkout everywhere.
# This only works for the very specific crate listed here, and not for its dependency tree.
# Alternatively, the whole dependency tree can be changed at once by putting this line into
# `crates/symbolicator/Cargo.toml`:
# symbolic = { path = "../../../symbolic/symbolic", features = ["common-serde", "debuginfo", "demangle", "minidump-serde", "symcache"] }
# See also https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html
